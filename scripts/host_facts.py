"""host_facts.py — the facts about other people's repos that `check.py` rests on.

About a dozen of `check.py`'s rules are copies of behaviour in `forge-concept` or
`@skaile/workspaces`. Until this table they were justified by comments naming a
`file:line`, and nothing re-checked them: ticket 40 measured 14 distinct refs and found
**4 rotted in roughly two weeks while every underlying fact still held**. A reference
that resolves to nothing quietly is this collection's own defect class, so the coupling
gets what every other reference here gets — one enumerable place, a date, and a test.

A row is one *fact*, not one rule: `profiles.get.ts` reading `meta.onboarding` backs
three rules, and the verifier greps facts. Each row carries

  id         `host:<slug>`, the token a rule cites via `rep.error(..., fact=...)`
  host       a key of `HOSTS`
  path       repo-relative, inside that host
  signature  a **grep-able token**, never a line number — a distinctive string
             survives a refactor and `:47` does not, which is what the measurement showed
  expect     `present` | `absent`; absence is first-class, because a host that *gains*
             a `${...}` resolver silently makes a ban wrong and nothing would say so
  claim      one sentence, the thing the rules actually depend on
  rules      the rule ids resting on it. Not prose: every `rep.error(..., fact=...)`
             site passes `rule=`, `Report.error` refuses an id this column does not
             list, and `test_check.py` reconciles both directions against `check.py`'s
             AST — so a fact no rule cites and a rule id no site uses both fail. A
             column only a human reads would rot exactly like the line numbers did
  verified   ISO date the signature was last confirmed by `verify_host.py`
  seen_at    **advisory output**, refreshed by `verify_host.py --update`. Never
             hand-maintained: line numbers are what rotted.

Nothing here is imported for its line numbers. `check.py` interpolates `path` into its
error text so a message cannot drift out of step with its row, and
`scripts/verify_host.py` greps the signatures against local checkouts.

No rule currently rests on `platform`; it stays in `HOSTS` because the collection is
installed there too and the next fact may be its.

This file lives in `templates/`, not in `contracts/`. Its readers are templates, not skills, so
it does not meet the contracts bar (ADR 0004: a contract is something a skill reads at a step).
Its readers are also seven, so duplicating it seven times was the alternative.

This is the canonical recipe set for making generated apps run inside the
Skaile workspace's preview iframe. The platform side of the contract (the
proxy that mounts each session at `/preview/<session-id>/...` and the env vars
it injects) is defined in the `platform` repo; this document captures
everything an app needs to do to satisfy that contract.

A copy of this guide is also published as user-facing docs at
`platform/docs/preview-app-compatibility.md`. The two are kept in sync
deliberately so app authors and skill authors read from the same source.

## TL;DR — what every preview-ready app needs

To run cleanly in the workspace preview, an app must:

1. **Read its base path from `SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE`** in its framework config —
   Vite `base`, SvelteKit `paths.base`, Next `basePath`, Nuxt `app.baseURL`.
2. **Use base-aware navigation primitives** — the framework's `<Link>` /
   `router.push()` / `goto()` / `navigateTo()`. Never bare `<a href="/foo">`
   or `window.location.href = '/foo'`.
3. **Use path-relative API calls** — `fetch('/api/users')`, never hardcoded
   `fetch('http://localhost:8000/users')`.

Templates that scaffold preview-ready apps must inject (1) into the relevant
config file at scaffold time, document (2) and (3) in their convention rules,
and ship a `nav.ts`-style helper for any framework that doesn't auto-prepend
the base path (currently SvelteKit only).

## Why this isn't automatic

Browsers enforce `Location` and all its members as `[LegacyUnforgeable]` per
the WebIDL spec — `location.pathname`, `location.href`, `location.assign(...)`,
`location.replace(...)` cannot be redefined from JavaScript. The Skaile
preview proxy injects a small client-side patch that wraps `history.pushState`
/ `history.replaceState` / `fetch` / `WebSocket` / `XMLHttpRequest.open`, but
it *cannot* intercept `Location` reads or writes.

Consequence: if an app reads `location.pathname` directly to make routing
decisions, or writes `window.location.href = '/foo'` to navigate, the proxy
can't help. The framework has to be told about its base path, and the
framework's own router has to handle it.

## Environment variables the preview manager injects

Every preview container runs with these set:

| Env var | Example value | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| `SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE` | `/preview/8a3f.../` (FE) or `/preview/8a3f.../api/` (BE) | The proxy path this role is mounted under, **with trailing slash** |
| `SKAILE_PREVIEW_ROLE` | `frontend` \| `backend` | Which role this container is serving |
| `SKAILE_PREVIEW_SESSION_ID` | `8a3f...` | Raw session UUID, in case the app needs it |

Outside preview (production deploys, plain `bun run dev` locally), the env
vars are unset. Configs **must** fall back to `'/'` (or empty string when the
framework expects no base path) — never crash if the var is missing.

## Per-framework recipes

### SvelteKit

SvelteKit needs **two** things: the config, and a navigation wrapper. Unlike
Next/Nuxt, SvelteKit's `goto('/foo')` does **not** auto-prepend `paths.base` —
the app code has to do it itself.

**`svelte.config.js`:**

```js
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-node";
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";

// SvelteKit wants paths.base WITHOUT trailing slash, with leading slash, or "".
const previewBase = (process.env.SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE ?? "").replace(/\/+$/, "");

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
    paths: { base: previewBase },
  },
};

export default config;
```

**`src/lib/nav.ts`** (or wherever app utilities live):

```ts
import { goto as svelteGoto } from "$app/navigation";
import { base } from "$app/paths";

/**
 * Wraps SvelteKit's `goto` to auto-prepend the configured base path so
 * internal navigation works behind a preview proxy or any subpath deploy.
 *
 * Pass-through for absolute URLs (`https://...`, `mailto:...`, `//cdn/...`)
 * and paths that already include the base (idempotent — safe to double-call).
 */
export function goto(
  path: string,
  opts?: Parameters<typeof svelteGoto>[1],
): ReturnType<typeof svelteGoto> {
  if (/^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*:|^\/\//i.test(path)) return svelteGoto(path, opts);
  if (base && (path === base || path.startsWith(`${base}/`))) {
    return svelteGoto(path, opts);
  }
  const normalized = path.startsWith("/") ? path : `/${path}`;
  return svelteGoto(`${base}${normalized}`, opts);
}
```

**`src/lib/Link.svelte`** for in-app anchors (SvelteKit doesn't ship a
`<Link>` component; bare `<a href>` is what you get):

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { base } from "$app/paths";

  let { href, children, ...rest } = $props<{ href: string; children: unknown }>();

  const resolved = $derived(
    /^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*:|^\/\//i.test(href)
      ? href
      : base && (href === base || href.startsWith(`${base}/`))
        ? href
        : `${base}${href.startsWith("/") ? href : `/${href}`}`,
  );
</script>

<a href={resolved} {...rest}>{@render children()}</a>
```

**Convention** in the app code:

- Always import `goto` from `$lib/nav`, never from `$app/navigation` directly.
- Use `<Link>` from `$lib/Link.svelte` instead of raw `<a href>`.
- Done. `goto('/dashboard')` and `<Link href="/dashboard">` both resolve
  correctly in preview *and* in production.

### Next.js

Next's `<Link>` and `useRouter().push()` are already base-aware once
`basePath` is set — no helpers needed.

**`next.config.js`:**

```js
const previewBase = (process.env.SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE ?? "").replace(/\/+$/, "");

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Empty string disables Next's basePath; falsy values must be `undefined`
  // (not `''`) — passing an empty string trips Next's config validator.
  basePath: previewBase || undefined,
};

export default nextConfig;
```

In app code: keep using `<Link href="/dashboard">` and
`router.push('/dashboard')` as normal. Next prepends `basePath` automatically.

### Nuxt

Nuxt's `<NuxtLink>` and `navigateTo()` are already base-aware once
`app.baseURL` is set — no helpers needed.

**`nuxt.config.ts`:**

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    // Nuxt expects a value WITH trailing slash, defaulting to "/".
    baseURL: process.env.SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE ?? "/",
  },
});
```

In app code: keep using `<NuxtLink to="/dashboard">` and
`await navigateTo('/dashboard')` as normal. Nuxt prepends `baseURL`
automatically.

### Vite + React Router

For an SPA bundled by Vite, the asset base path is set on Vite, and the
router gets its own base via `basename`.

**`vite.config.ts`:**

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: process.env.SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE ?? "/",
});
```

**`src/main.tsx`:**

```tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  // import.meta.env.BASE_URL is what Vite injects for `base` above —
  // strip the trailing slash for React Router's `basename`.
  <BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/+$/, "")}>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
);
```

In app code: `<Link to="/dashboard">` and `navigate('/dashboard')` work
normally; React Router prepends `basename` automatically.

### Vite (no router)

For a plain Vite SPA without a client-side router, only the asset base needs
configuring:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: process.env.SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE ?? "/",
});
```

Vite rewrites `<script src="/x.js">`, `<link href="/y.css">`, and `import` /
`new URL()` literals at build time. Asset URLs come out correct in both
preview and production. There's nothing to do for navigation because there
is none.

## Anti-patterns — what doesn't work

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `goto('/foo')` (SvelteKit, bare) | `goto(\`${base}/foo\`)` or `$lib/nav` wrapper | SvelteKit's `goto` doesn't auto-prepend `paths.base`; bare `/foo` looks external to SvelteKit's router and triggers a hard `location.href = ...` that escapes the iframe |
| `<a href="/foo">` in any framework | Framework `<Link>` / `<NuxtLink>` / `<a href="{base}/foo">` | Browser navigation through a bare `<a>` doesn't go through SPA routers — it does a full page load that, on `/foo`, escapes the iframe |
| `window.location.href = '/foo'` | Framework `goto` / `router.push` / `navigateTo` | `Location.href` is `[LegacyUnforgeable]` — the proxy's client patch cannot intercept this |
| `window.location.assign('/foo')` | Same | Same reason |
| `fetch('http://localhost:8000/users')` | `fetch('/api/users')` | Hardcoded host bypasses the preview proxy entirely; backend-only previews depend on the `/api` prefix routing |
| Hardcoded API base in env | `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE` defaulting to `'/api'` | Path-relative survives both preview and production behind a reverse proxy |

## What the proxy *can* patch

For completeness — these don't need help from the app, the proxy's injected
client patch handles them:

- `history.pushState` / `history.replaceState` — SPA-internal navigations
  stay inside the preview base
- `fetch` — relative URLs are rewritten to the preview base
- `new WebSocket()` — same
- `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open` — same
- ES module `import()` specifier resolution — via injected
  `<script type="importmap">`
- HTTP redirect `Location` headers from the server — rewritten on the way
  back through the proxy

## Limits accepted

Apps that absolutely require unmodifiable hard navigation through `location`
cannot be made preview-compatible without code changes. The "deploy mode"
roadmap mentions a subdomain-per-session preview as a future option that
would sidestep this entirely (each session gets its own origin, no path
prefix needed) — but that's not the path-prefix preview's mandate.

## Template authors — checklist

When writing or updating a `template-*` template that targets a web framework, ensure:

- [ ] The Scaffold Recipe injects the relevant `SKAILE_PREVIEW_BASE` read
  into the generated framework config file
- [ ] The fall-back value is correct for the framework (`'/'` for Nuxt,
  `undefined` for Next, `""` after trim for SvelteKit, `'/'` for Vite)
- [ ] A `## Preview Compatibility` section in the template points at this file
  and shows the exact config snippet
- [ ] Anti-patterns relevant to the framework are listed (bare `goto`,
  bare `<a href>`, hardcoded `localhost` fetch URLs)
- [ ] For SvelteKit specifically: the template ships `src/lib/nav.ts` and
  `src/lib/Link.svelte` and codifies "always import `goto` from `$lib/nav`"
  as a convention rule

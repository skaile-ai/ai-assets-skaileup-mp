# build-branch

The bookend around a run of slices: it opens the branch the slices are committed to, and it
closes it. Nothing between the two ends is its business — `build-implement` commits, and this
skill never does.

## Steps

1. **Read which end this is from git, not from the user.** No branch matching
   `build/<app-slug>` — the slug from `brief.md` — means open. The branch checked out with
   commits on it means close. Both readings possible (the branch exists and no slice has
   landed) is a resume: say which branch you found and continue on it.

## Opening

2. **Start from a clean tree.** `git status --porcelain` empty, or stop and say what is
   uncommitted — a branch cut over someone's work carries it along invisibly. Initialize the
   repo with a `.gitignore` first if there is none.
3. **Create `build/<app-slug>`** and give it an empty initial commit, so the branch has a base
   to diff and revert against before any slice touches it.
4. **Offer a worktree.** `git worktree add .worktrees/<app-slug> build/<app-slug>` keeps the
   build checkout beside the main one, which is worth it when the user wants to run or read
   `main` while a slice is in flight, and is overhead otherwise. Add `.worktrees/` to
   `.gitignore`; a worktree is local and belongs to nobody else.

## Closing

5. **Check that every slice landed.** Any directory under `11_build/slices/` without an
   `index.md` is a slice whose commits never happened — name them and stop, because closing
   the branch is how that work gets lost. Frozen dossiers are expected to stay; they are the
   documentation.
6. **Run the full suite** and stop on a failure. Merging or opening a PR on red asks somebody
   else to discover it.
7. **Offer the four endings and let the user choose one.** **merge** squash-merges to the base
   branch and deletes the branch; **pull-request** opens a PR with the slice commits and their
   feature specs in the body and leaves the branch for review; **keep** leaves everything as it
   is; **discard** deletes the branch and its work. Merge and discard each need the word typed
   back before anything runs — they are the two that cannot be undone from here.
8. **Resolve conflicts with `resolving-merge-conflicts`** if the merge hits any. Both sides of
   a conflict here are deliberate work: one is a landed slice with a spec behind it, and that
   spec is the intent the resolution preserves.
9. **Remove the worktree** on every ending, and report the branch's final state — merged and
   deleted, open with a PR URL, kept, or discarded.

**Done when** the branch exists and is checked out (opening), or the user's chosen ending has
run and the worktree is gone (closing).

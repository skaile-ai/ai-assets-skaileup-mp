# run_validator.sh — structural validation for patch skill output.
#
# IMPORTANT: This script does NOT run the LLM. It validates a patches output
# that a human or agent has already produced. Run it AFTER the patch skill
# has generated patches/<sid>.json and patches/<sid>.review.md.
#
# Usage (paths resolve relative to this file):
#   bash tests/run_validator.sh <patches-json> <review-md> <triage-json> [<session-json>]
#
# For CI / batch mode, the agent should:
#   1. Run the patch SKILL.md against each fixture triage JSON.
#   2. Call this script on the output.

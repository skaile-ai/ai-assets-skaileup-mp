# \_concept/ Directory Structure

All skills read and write to a `_concept/` folder inside the target project.
This is the canonical structure. Skills must use these exact paths.

## concept.yaml — Project Manifest

Every `_concept/` directory contains a `concept.yaml` at its root. This manifest tracks:

- Project type and profile (web-app, cli-tool, etc.)
- Per-domain tier settings
- Artifact status (which artifacts exist, their source, last_updated)
- Grounding artifact status (research, onboarding)
- Seed mapping (which seeds map to which artifacts)

```yaml
type: web-app
profile: web-app # references contracts/profiles/web-app.yaml

artifacts:
  brief:
    status: approved
    source: generated
    produced_by: concept-brief
    last_updated: 2026-04-25
  features:

    source: seed-partial
    seed_file: '_seeds/feature-list.md'

## \_grounding/ — Research, Reference & User Input Layer

`_grounding/` is a **special, unnumbered folder** outside the pipeline sequence.
It is the primary destination for all research output and persisted user inputs.

**Key rules:**

- **Written by:** the research mode (runs in parallel with any pipeline step) and skills saving user inputs
- **Read by:** ALL skills — always available as input regardless of which folder a skill owns
- **Not numbered:** leading underscore signals infrastructure, not a sequential step

**Structure:**

- **`onboarding/`** — written by the UI wizard at project start.
  - `profile.yaml` — project profile: name, type, tier, audience, problem statement
  - `decisions.yaml` — collected decisions: tech-stack preferences, research depth, route
  - `inputs/` — per-skill dialog field values preserved as JSON for resume (e.g. `overview.json`, `features.json`)
  - Skills that make tech stack or architecture decisions read `profile.yaml` and `decisions.yaml` first
    and skip questions already answered here.
- **`research/`** — cross-cutting research artifacts: domain, competitors, audiences, design
  inspiration, patterns, colors/fonts, behavioral patterns. Written by the research skill; read
  by all pipeline skills.
- **`findings/`** — raw material (screenshots, saved pages, excerpts). `index.md` catalogs all
  entries with source and date.
- **`step/`** — step-specific research dispatched alongside a pipeline skill, organized by skill
  name. Each subfolder mirrors the convention below.

Step subfolder names under `_grounding/step/` map to the final segment of the skill path:

| Skill                       | `_grounding/step/` subfolder |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `concept-brief`         | `step/overview/`             |
| `product-spec-features`         | `step/features/`             |
| `experience-behaviors`        | `step/behaviors/`            |
| `design-brand-visual`     | `step/brand-visual/`         |
| `design-brand-voice` | `step/brand-behavioral/`     |
| `impl-architecture-techstack`        | `step/techstack/`            |
| `impl-architecture-system`     | `step/architecture/`         |
| `impl-architecture-datamodel`        | `step/datamodel/`            |
| `experience-screens`          | `step/screens/`              |
| `experience-components`       | `step/components/`           |

## \_seeds/ — User-Provided Input Layer

`_seeds/` is an **unnumbered input layer** where users place existing material before or during a
concept pipeline run.

**Key rules:**

- **Written by:** the user (manual drop) — not generated by any skill
- **Read by:** `concept-grounding-seeds` — classifies files by content analysis and maps each to an artifact slot
- **Seed states:** `seed` (complete, ready to use), `seed-partial` (usable but incomplete), `seed-reference` (inspiration only)
- **Tracking:** once ingested, each seed is recorded in `concept.yaml` under the `artifacts` or `grounding` section with its mapped artifact, seed state, and source file path

Skills do not read `_seeds/` directly. They read the canonical artifact paths and check `concept.yaml`
to learn whether an artifact was produced from a seed (and at what completeness level).

## \_standards/ — Discovered Codebase Standards

`_standards/` is a **special, unnumbered folder** (like `_grounding/`) that stores
conventions discovered from an existing codebase.

**Key rules:**

- **Written by:** `support/standards-discover` (mode-based, runs in parallel like research)
- **Read by:** ALL skills — always available regardless of which folder a skill owns
- **Index file:** `index.yml` provides fast matching of standards to skills by `applies_to` and `keywords`

When `_standards/` exists, skills check for applicable standards before making decisions
(see Standards Injection pattern in `agent_patterns.md`).

## slices/ — Per-Feature Concept Dossiers (frozen, kept)

`slices/` holds one folder per feature run through the **concept-slice loop**
(`brainstorm → align → scope-feature → design-feature`). `<slice_id> == feature_slug`.

**Key rules:**

- **Written by:** the concept-slice cluster. `brainstorm`, `align`, and `scope-feature`
  each write their phase handoff; `design-feature` is the terminator.
- **Frozen, not deleted:** when `design-feature` commits a feature's canonical artifacts
  (`experience/features/...`, `experience/screens/<feature_slug>/...`,
  `mockup-walkthrough/<tier>/<feature_slug>.<ext>`), it writes `index.md` and **keeps**
  the slice folder as permanent per-feature documentation. The phase handoffs are the
  decision record; `index.md` links forward to the canonical artifacts.
- **The general (non-slice) part** — brief, goals, brand, journeys, grounding, datamodel,
  techstack, architecture — lives in its phase folders and is **not** per-slice. Slices
  hold only what is specific to one feature.
- **Frozen vs in-flight:** a slice with an `index.md` is frozen (complete); a slice folder
  without one is still in flight.

The implementation side mirrors this exactly under `_implementation/slices/<slice_id>/`
(`brainstorm · align · plan · test · recap · refactor · index`), frozen by `impl-slice-commit`.
On freeze, `impl-slice-commit` also back-links the feature spec: it writes `slice_ref`,
`commits`, and `source_files` into the feature file's frontmatter (diff-first, never
clobbering other keys) so `ops-trace` can walk feature → slice → commits → code.

## blueprint/datamodel/ — Schema Format

The agent selects the schema format from the project's tech stack
(read from `blueprint/techstack.md` or `_grounding/onboarding/decisions.yaml`):

| Stack signal            | Schema file(s)                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic / unknown       | `model.dbml` + `model.json` (human-readable + editor state)               |
| Prisma detected         | `schema.prisma`                                                           |
| PostXL / NestJS         | `postxl-schema.json`                                                      |
| Multiple outputs needed | Produce canonical `model.dbml` first, then emit the stack-specific format |

Regardless of schema format, `seed.json` and `feature_map.json` are always produced.

`seed.json` uses named scenarios (`empty`, `single_user`, `populated`, `edge_cases`).
`feature_map.json` maps each model to its source feature files (used by implementation skills
and quality audit for cross-reference validation).

## Naming Rules

- Phase folders use plain names with no numeric prefix: `discovery/`, `experience/`, `blueprint/`, `prototype/`
- Discovery artifacts live directly in `discovery/` (brief.md, goals.md, comparable.md) or in `discovery/brand/`
- Feature groups and screen groups: `01_<group_name>/` (two-digit prefix, matching across both)
- Screen groups mirror feature group numbers exactly
- Special folders: leading underscore (`_grounding/`, `_seeds/`, `_standards/`, `_feedback/`) — not sequential steps
- `slices/` is a plain (unnumbered) folder of per-feature dossiers, one subfolder per `<slice_id>` (== feature_slug)
- File names: lowercase, hyphen-separated or underscore-separated (`password_reset.md`)
- No spaces in paths

## Feature Files — Permissions Section

Each feature file in `experience/features/` includes:

```markdown
---
permissions:
  admin: [create, read, update, delete]
  member: [read, update]
  guest: [read]
---

## Permissions

| Role   | Actions                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| admin  | create, read, update, delete |
| member | read, update                 |
| guest  | read                         |
```

This is consumed by `blueprint/datamodel/` (auth rules) and implementation scaffolding
(authorization policy).

## Read Direction

Skills read from **earlier pipeline phases** and write to **their own** folder only.

| Skill writing to                        | May read from                                                                                                                               |

`_grounding/` and `_standards/` are always readable by every skill regardless of phase.

`experience/behaviors/` is optional. Skills that consume it (`blueprint/architecture.md`, `blueprint/datamodel/`,
`experience/screens/`) check for its existence before reading.

`blueprint/architecture.md` is optional. Skills writing to `blueprint/datamodel/` and `experience/screens/`
read it when present to understand service boundaries, data flows, and protocols.

**Parallel tracks:** Brand, Journeys→Features, and Techstack run in parallel after the
overview. Architecture depends on Features + Techstack. Datamodel depends on
Features + Techstack + Architecture. Screens and Storybook depend on everything above.

`_grounding/` feeds every step. The research skill can run alongside any pipeline phase,
continuously enriching the knowledge base. Per-skill dialog values are stored in
`_grounding/onboarding/inputs/{step}.json` and loaded on resume.

## Legacy Path Compatibility

Projects **not yet migrated** via `_scripts/migrate-concept-v2.sh` may have v1 numbered paths:

| v1 path (legacy)                             | v2 path (current)           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `1_discovery/1_overview/brief.md`            | `discovery/brief.md`        |
| `1_discovery/1_overview/goals.md`            | `discovery/goals.md`        |
| `1_discovery/1_overview/comparable.md`       | `discovery/comparable.md`   |
| `1_discovery/2_brand/`                       | `discovery/brand/`          |
| `2_experience/1_journeys/`                   | `experience/journeys/`      |
| `2_experience/2_features/`                   | `experience/features/`      |
| `2_experience/3_screens/`                    | `experience/screens/`       |
| `2_experience/4_behaviors/`                  | `experience/behaviors/`     |
| `2_experience/5_storybook/`                  | `prototype/storybook/`      |
| `3_blueprint/1_techstack/stack.md`           | `blueprint/techstack.md`    |
| `3_blueprint/2_architecture/architecture.md` | `blueprint/architecture.md` |
| `3_blueprint/3_datamodel/`                   | `blueprint/datamodel/`      |

Additional legacy paths from older CF tooling:

- `01_project/`, `03_features/`, `04_brand/` etc. (flat numbered structure) — read both old and new paths, prefer new
- `_research/` or `02_research/` — treat as `_grounding/research/` content
- `A_01_<group>/` feature group prefix (letter+number) — treat same as `01_<group>/`
- `_grounding/general/` — treat as `_grounding/research/` content (rename on next write)
- `_grounding/{step}/user_input.json` (e.g. `_grounding/overview/user_input.json`) — treat as `_grounding/onboarding/inputs/{step}.json`
- `_grounding/onboarding-info.md` — treat as legacy equivalent of `_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml` + `_grounding/onboarding/decisions.yaml`; extract and split on next write

Skills should detect legacy structure from file existence and migrate output to the new paths.
Run `_scripts/migrate-concept-v2.sh <project-dir>` to migrate a project in bulk.

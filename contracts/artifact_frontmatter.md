# Frontmatter Schema — _concept/ Output Files

> **Scope:** This document defines YAML frontmatter for files written *into* `_concept/` by skills (brief.md, feature files, screen files, stack.md, etc.).
> For the manifest frontmatter of skills, agents, prompts, and flows themselves, see `asset_frontmatter.md`.

All markdown files in `_concept/` use YAML frontmatter.
Skills must use these field names exactly.

## Universal Fields

Every markdown file in `_concept/`:

## experience/journeys/stories.yaml

JSON file — no frontmatter. Structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "personas": [
    {
      "id": "persona_id",
      "name": "Persona Name",
      "role": "role_name",
      "goals": ["..."]
    }
  ],
  "journeys": [
    {
      "id": "journey_id",
      "persona": "persona_id",
      "title": "Journey Title",
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "What the user does",
          "system_response": "What the system does",
          "acceptance": "EARS-format acceptance criterion"
        }
      ],
      "candidate_features": ["feature_slug"],
      "candidate_entities": ["EntityName"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## experience/features/\<group\>/\<feature\>.md

```yaml
---
priority: must-have | nice-to-have
roles: [all_users]              # or [admin, member, guest]
permissions:                    # role → allowed actions
  admin: [view, create, edit, delete]
  member: [view, create]
  guest: [view]
story_refs: []                  # journey IDs from stories.yaml that motivated this feature
agent_notes: |
  Free-form notes from the agent about this feature.
  Used for context across sessions.
screens: []                     # populated by screens skill
data_entities: []               # populated by datamodel skill
slice_ref: ""                   # populated by impl-slice-commit: _implementation/slices/<slice_id>/
commits: []                     # populated by impl-slice-commit: git SHAs that shipped this feature
source_files: []                # populated by impl-slice-commit: code files from recap.md "## Files touched"
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### screens[] format (populated by downstream skill)

```yaml
screens:
  - path: experience/screens/01_user_auth/login.md
```

### data_entities[] format (populated by downstream skill)

```yaml
data_entities: [User, Session]
```

### back-link format (populated by impl-slice-commit on freeze)

Forward-built features get code back-links when their slice is frozen —
same shape `ops-reverse-engineer` writes for imported repos:

```yaml
slice_ref: _implementation/slices/login/
commits: [abc1234, deadbeef1234567]      # 7-40 hex chars each
source_files:
  - src/routes/login.ts
  - src/components/LoginForm.tsx
```

`ops-trace` (Direction 1) treats an empty `commits`/`source_files` on a
frozen slice's feature as a red trace row.

## experience/screens/\<group\>/\<screen\>.md

```yaml
---
implements:
  - experience/features/01_user_auth/login.md
  - experience/features/01_user_auth/registration.md
data_entities: [User]
layout: experience/screens/00_layout/shell.md
elements: []                    # OPTIONAL — see contracts/elements_block.md
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

For the optional `elements:` block (used by walkthrough renderers and the mockup-feedback loop), see `contracts/elements_block.md`.

## blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json

JSON file — no frontmatter. Maps each model to its source feature files:

```json
{
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "models": {
    "User": {
      "source_features": [
        "experience/features/01_user_auth/login.md",
        "experience/features/01_user_auth/registration.md"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
